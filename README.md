# CZ4046 : Intelligent Agents

## Learning Outcome
I have learnt fundamentals in reinforcement learning (RL) and the two RL algorithms such as **Value Iteration** and 
**Policy Iteraiton**. I have also gained knowledge regarding Individual/Single Agent as well as Multi-Agent System (MAS).
The coursework includes two assignments : 
1) Implementing Value Iteration and Policy Iteration algorithms to find the optimal policy for a given maze environment
2) Implementing Repeated Prisoners' Dilemma (the scenario involving three players) 


## Coursework Assignments

Assignment 1: Implemented ``Value Iteration`` and ``Policy Iteration`` by using Java code in order to find the best policy for 
a given maze environment

Assignment 2: Implemented a player class to compete with other players by using java code in the scenario, ``Repeated Prisoners' Dilemma``. 

Please refer to the two assignment/project reports for more details. 

**Disclaimer : The Java code used to build the coursework assignments is no longer maintained. There may be errors or bugs that did not exist at the time of creation.**
